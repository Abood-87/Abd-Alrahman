    <h1>Qasr Amra</h1>
<p style="width: 700px; text-align: justify;">
Qasr Amra, also known as Quseir Amra, is one of the most significant and well-preserved desert castles built by the Umayyad Caliphs in the early 8th century, around 723 AD. 
Located in the eastern desert of Jordan, near the city of Zarqa, it was originally constructed during the reign of Caliph Walid I. 
This small yet richly decorated structure was not a military fortress, but rather a royal retreat or hunting lodge used by the Umayyad rulers.
<br>The most remarkable feature of Qasr Amra is its interior frescoes—wall and ceiling paintings that depict a wide range of subjects, including scenes of daily life, animals, musicians, hunting scenes, and even zodiac constellations. These frescoes provide a rare glimpse into the cultural and artistic expression of early Islamic civilization and show clear influence from Byzantine and Persian art.<br>

One of the most famous frescoes in the building is found in the audience hall and depicts six kings from different parts of the world, symbolizing the power and reach of the Umayyad Caliphate. 
Another standout feature is the bathhouse, which includes a caldarium (hot room), tepidarium (warm room), and frigidarium (cold room)—a layout clearly inspired by Roman baths. 
The ceiling of the caldarium contains one of the earliest known representations of the night sky on a hemispherical surface, showing the zodiac and over 400 stars.<br>
Qasr Amra was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, due to its unique historical, artistic, and architectural value. 
Today, it stands as a testament to the sophistication and cultural richness of the Umayyad period and attracts visitors and historians from all over the world.
